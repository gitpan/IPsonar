IPsonar

The IPsonar module is intended to make it easier to interact with 
Lumeta's IPsonar application.

In a nutshell IPsonar is a large-scale network mapping and discovery
tool.  It has a reporting engine and this library helps to wrap that
API.

At the moment you'll want to have access to an IPsonar report server
to run the included tests.  They will assume that you have the following
environment variables set:

TEST_RSN = The report server DNS name or IP address.
TEST_REPORT = The report that you'll be using to test against.

If you don't have access to a report server those tests will be skipped.

There are currently a number of dependencies around XML and the
modules required to communicate with a RESTful https server.
